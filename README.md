-My_Calculator_1

Description
- My_calculator_1 is a calculator project that I build using Java, initially I implemented with switch cases for arithmetic operator's but later changed to using methods for maintanability, reusability and testing purposes.
- I'm practicing testing using Test Driven Development(TDD) with Junit following Arrange-Act-Assert(AAA) pattern. 
- I have 4 methods, each of them perform it's unique function.
- Addition adds two numbers and return a sum.
- Subtraction subtract a second number from the first number and return a difference.
- Multiplication multiplies two numbers and return a product.
- Division divides a 1st number by a second number and return a Quotient, but does not allow a second number to be 0.
