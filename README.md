**Description**

My_Calculator_1 is a Java-based calculator project designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. Originally implemented using switch-case statements, the project was refactored to use individual methods for each operation to improve maintainability, reusability, and testability.
This project practices Test Driven Development (TDD) using JUnit and follows the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern for writing clean and effective tests.

**Features**

Addition: Adds two numbers and returns their sum.

Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first and returns the difference.

Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers and returns the product.

Division: Divides the first number by the second and returns the quotient, ensuring that division by zero is not allowed.

**Testing**

This project is built with a focus on Test Driven Development (TDD). Unit tests for each method are written using JUnit and follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern for clarity and structure.
